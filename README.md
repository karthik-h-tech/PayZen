## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (^3.8.1)
- Dart SDK

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthik-h-tech/COOEEPay.git
   cd cooeepay
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Configuration
Optional: Use a real mock API endpoint:
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=CHECKOUT_ENDPOINT=https://your.mock/endpoint
```
Without this, app uses a local fallback for checkout simulation.

## Usage

1. Launch app → Welcome screen → Tap “Get Started”.
2. Select a plan (Free/Premium/Pro) → Enter promo code COOEE20 (optional).
3. Proceed to payment confirmation → Confirm & Pay.
   - For **Free plan**, payment is skipped; “Confirm & Pay” immediately activates the plan.
   - For **Premium or Pro plans**, user selects a payment method → Mock API simulates success or error → Displays confetti or error animation.
4. Use “Return to Dashboard” to go back to welcome screen.

## Advantages

- **Easy to Understand**: Clear plan selection and payment flow.
- **Reusable Components**: Widgets and dialogs are modular, maintainable, and structured for readability.
- **Engaging UI**: Lottie animations and confetti for success improve user experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for various screen sizes and orientations for better accessibility.
- **Mock API Ready**: Payment flow can integrate with real endpoints without affecting app structure.
- **Structured Flow**: Free vs Paid plan logic ensures smooth user journey and avoids unnecessary steps.
